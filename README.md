# Personal Desktop Configurations

These are my personal tweaks for daily usage. Most configurations could be used separately, I personally use all of them together. Feel free to copy, edit and do anything you want to do.

I chose Seti UI as my default theme for terminal and all tools compatible with [base16 templates](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-templates-source). For fonts, I use MesloLGS Nerd Font, from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), it's very nice and I have no problems with it.

## Setup

Just make sure you have GNU make installed in your system and run `make` in order to install all configurations. If you just want a specific configuration, you can run the other actions separately. You can also use the `make clean` action in order to remove all the configurations.
